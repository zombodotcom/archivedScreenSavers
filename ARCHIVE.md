## Notes

- **"Blank Screen"** is omitted from most tables after its first appearance per OS, but virtually every OS version included it.
- **Photo Slideshow** variants are grouped rather than listing each presentation style individually, as they display the same content with different transitions.
- **XScreenSaver** has 240+ individual modules — only the most notable are listed. The full catalog with video previews is maintained at jwz.org/xscreensaver/screenshots/.
- **After Dark** module counts varied by edition, platform, and expansion packs. The lists above cover the core modules; expansion packs like "More After Dark" and themed collections added dozens more.
- **Windows Plus!** packs were sold separately and are listed under their respective Windows versions.
- **Johnny Castaway** (Sierra, 1992) was technically a third-party screensaver, not part of After Dark, but is frequently associated with the era and deserves mention for being a screensaver that told an ongoing narrative story.
