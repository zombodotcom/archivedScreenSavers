# Add 3D Shaders to Originals

This plan outlines the steps to add powerful new 3D shaders to the "aSS Originals (2024)" screensaver mix, while ensuring we do not touch or ruin the classic effects used in other categories.

## Proposed Changes

### src/js/effects.js
#### [MODIFY] effects.js
- Add `matrix3d`: A high-fidelity 3D Digital Rain shader, giving it perspective, glowing characters, and a much more powerful visual aesthetic. The classic `matrix` effect will be untouched.
- Add `cyberpipes`: A neon/cyberpunk raymarched variant of 3D pipes with glowing emissions. The classic `pipes` effect will be untouched.
- Add `voxelcity`: A 3D raymarched flight through an endless neon schematic city.

- Modify `pipes_ag` to include a structured `settings` panel allowing the user to tweak its parameters (like color speed, pipe thickness, etc.) to match the customizability of the classic `pipes`.
- Add `warp_ag`: High-speed raymarched star warp.
- Add `rain_ag`: Cinematic 3D rain simulation.
- Add `aurora_ag`: Volumetric Northern Lights shader.
- Add `neongrid_ag`: 80s synthwave retrowave landscape.
- Add `glplanet_ag`: High-detail 3D Earth planet with atmosphere.
- Add `hyperspace_ag`: Multi-dimensional tunnel.
- Add `timetunnel_ag`: Clock/time themed dimensional rift.
- Add `helios_ag`: Volumetric sun/plasma sphere.
- Add `fireflies_ag`: Interactive glowing boids.
- Add `electropaint_ag`: Fluid simulation paint trails.
Note: All new shaders will have ` -Antigravity` in their descriptions and will not replace the classic implementations in other categories.

### Shadertoy Integrations
- Replace the current `fireworks` and `neongrid_ag` shaders with much higher quality alternatives based on user feedback.
- Port and integrate the following 13 Shadertoy URLs into [effects.js](file:///c:/Users/zombo/Desktop/Programming/archivedScreenSavers/src/js/effects.js): `lffSRN`, `tsXBzS`, `MdXSWn`, `tsScRK`, `4ttSWf`, `XsXXDn`, `Ms2SD1`, `Ml2XRD`, `wtcSzN`, `3l23Rh`, `XlfGRj`, `mtyGWy`, and `4dcGW2`.
- **CRITICAL**: For every ported Shadertoy, I will find the original author's name and explicitly include it in the effect's `desc` string (e.g., `'[Name] by [Author] -Antigravity'`).
- Update the [app.js](file:///c:/Users/zombo/Desktop/Programming/archivedScreenSavers/src/js/app.js) `originals` array to include all of these newly ported shaders.

### src/js/app.js
#### [MODIFY] app.js
- Update the `originals` era configuration in `ERAS`. Replace the old classic names with their new `_ag` suffixed versions.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Run `npm run build` using the terminal to assure Vite builds the project without syntax errors.

### Manual Verification
- Start the dev server (`npm run dev`).
- Open the application in the browser.
- Navigate to the "aSS Originals" category.
- Verify `cyberpipes` and `voxelcity` are available in the list.
- Click on each new effect and the updated `matrix` effect.
- Ensure they render beautifully without WebGL errors and run at a smooth framerate.
